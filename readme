Welcome to Base
===============

Base is a super simple, responsive framework designed to work for mobile devices, tablets, netbooks and desktop computers. It's built with accessibility in mind and uses minimal javascript for maximum awesomeness.

It includes a 12-column grid with some base styles for headings, links, tables, block quotes and much more.
